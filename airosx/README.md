# AIROX: AI/Robotics Operating System Prototype

## Overview
AIROX is a next-generation, general-purpose operating system designed from the ground up for AI, robotics, and autonomous systems. Its architecture is modular, real-time, and security-focused, enabling seamless integration of machine learning, sensor fusion, robotics control, and distributed intelligence. This prototype, written in pure Python (no external dependencies), serves as a blueprint for a future implementation in a systems language like Rust.

## Vision & Philosophy
- **AI-Native:** AIROX treats AI/ML workloads as first-class citizens, with built-in support for model management, inference, and distributed learning.
- **Robotics-First:** Real-time device management, sensor fusion, and actuator control are core to the OS.
- **Modular & Extensible:** Every subsystem is pluggable, from kernel modules to userland services.
- **Security & Safety:** Sandboxing, permissioning, and real-time monitoring are foundational.
- **Distributed & Scalable:** Designed for clusters of robots, edge devices, and cloud integration.

## Core System Modules (Prototype)
- `kernel.py` — Microkernel: process/thread/task management, scheduling, IPC.
- `device.py` — Device manager: drivers for sensors, actuators, and peripherals.
- `ai.py` — AI/ML subsystem: model registry, inference, training (simulated).
- `robotics.py` — Robotics control: kinematics, motion planning, sensor fusion.
- `ipc.py` — Inter-process communication: message passing, shared memory (simulated).
- `security.py` — Security: sandboxing, permissions, authentication.
- `fs.py` — Filesystem abstraction: virtual files, device files, config.
- `network.py` — Networking: sockets, distributed messaging (simulated).
- `scheduler.py` — Real-time and batch task scheduling.
- `monitor.py` — System monitoring: resource usage, health, logs.
- `user.py` — User/session management.
- `shell.py` — Command shell and scripting interface.
- `config.py` — System configuration and boot management.
- `logger.py` — Logging and error handling.
- `utils.py` — Utility functions/helpers.
- `app.py` — Main entry, simulating boot, device discovery, and core services.

## Paradigms & Design Principles
- **Microkernel:** Minimal kernel, with most services in user space for safety and extensibility.
- **Real-Time:** Deterministic scheduling and device control for robotics.
- **Event-Driven:** IPC, device, and AI events drive system behavior.
- **Security-First:** Sandboxing, permissions, and monitoring at every layer.
- **AI/Robotics Integration:** Native support for ML models, sensor fusion, and control loops.
- **Distributed:** Built-in support for clustering, remote procedure calls, and distributed AI.

---

## How the Prototype Works
- Each module is a pure Python file with minimal class/function stubs.
- `app.py` simulates the boot process, device discovery, and launching of core services.
- Device, AI, and robotics modules interact via simulated IPC and shared state.
- Security, monitoring, and configuration are integrated from the start.

## Translating to Rust: Key Considerations
- **Memory Safety:** Rust's ownership model is ideal for kernel and device code.
- **Concurrency:** Use async/await, channels, and lock-free data structures for real-time and parallelism.
- **Hardware Abstraction:** Use traits and generics for device drivers and AI/robotics modules.
- **Security:** Leverage Rust's type system and sandboxing for safe code execution.
- **Performance:** Optimize for low-latency, deterministic scheduling, and efficient IPC.
- **Testing:** Use Rust's test framework for kernel, device, and AI/robotics modules.
- **Distribution:** Use Rust's networking and serialization crates for distributed systems.

## Current Limitations
- No real hardware or OS integration (all simulated in Python).
- No real-time guarantees or hardware interrupts.
- No persistent storage or real networking.
- No actual ML/AI computation (all stubs).
- No real security enforcement (all simulated).

## Future Scope & Expansion
- Real hardware drivers and device abstraction layers.
- Real-time scheduling and preemption.
- Persistent, distributed filesystem.
- Real AI/ML model loading, inference, and training.
- Advanced robotics: SLAM, path planning, multi-agent coordination.
- Secure sandboxing and process isolation.
- Distributed clustering and remote management.
- Userland package management and app ecosystem.
- Comprehensive monitoring, logging, and analytics.
